	abstract = {This paper uses a dataset of over 900,000 news stories to test whether news can predict stock returns. It ﬁnds that ﬁrms with no news have distinctly diﬀerent average future returns than ﬁrms with news. We measure sentiment with the Harvard psychosocial dictionary used by Tetlock, SaarTsechansky, and Macskassy (2008), the ﬁnancial dictionary of Loughran and McDonald (2011), and a proprietary Thomson-Reuters neural network. Simpler processing techniques predict short-term returns that are quickly reversed, while more sophisticated techniques predict larger and more persistent returns. Conﬁrming previous research, daily news predicts stock returns for only 1-2 days. But weekly news predicts stock returns for a quarter year. Positive news stories increase stock returns quickly, but negative stories have a long-delayed reaction.},

	abstract = {In this work we present a deep learning based methodology for predicting eventdriven stock rallies. We apply neural methods to the data presented in [1] as well as a dataset created for this work that includes tweets. We implement a combination of neural networks using both textual and non-textual features to predict stock movements on days of 8-K report ﬁlings. Our best model, on the dataset from [1] (Task 1) using GloVe embeddings with an LSTM and fully connected layers achieves an accuracy of 51\%. Our model on the generated dataset (Task 2) performs at a 52.61\% accuracy. In both tasks, we observe that adding textual information improves model performance. We also ﬁnd that the attention distribution over full tweets yields exciting qualitative results, giving higher scores to tweets with rich information content.},

	abstract = {We investigate the impact of Form 8-K filings on cross-firm differences in analysts’ private or idiosyncratic information in the post-Reg FD era. Using firms’ connections to the investment community to identify the likelihood of selective disclosure, we document differences in analysts’ idiosyncratic information arising from selective disclosure before 8-K filings. While filings of 8-Ks pursuant to Reg FD attenuate the link between connections and analysts’ idiosyncratic information, they do so only after selective disclosures have already resulted in some analysts having better private information. In addition, the connections continue to facilitate private information search after the filings of non-Reg FD-specific 8-Ks.},

	abstract = {The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has mandated new disclosure requirements in Form 8-K, which became effective on August 23, 2004. The SEC expanded the list of items that have to be reported and accelerated the timeliness of these reports. This study examines the market reactions to 8-Ks filed under the new SEC regime and investigates whether periodic reports (10-K/Qs) became less informative under the new 8-K disclosure rules. We observe that the newly required 8-K items constitute over half of all filings and that most firms disclose the required items within the new shortened period (four business days). We find that all disclosed items (old and new) are associated with abnormal volume and return volatility around both the event and the SEC filing dates, and some items have significant return drifts after the SEC filings. Surprisingly, we find that the information content of periodic reports has not diminished by the more expansive and timely 8-K disclosures under the new guidance, possibly indicating that investors may use periodic filings to interpret the effects of material events that had been disclosed earlier.},
