	abstract = {This paper uses a dataset of over 900,000 news stories to test whether news can predict stock returns. It ﬁnds that ﬁrms with no news have distinctly diﬀerent average future returns than ﬁrms with news. We measure sentiment with the Harvard psychosocial dictionary used by Tetlock, SaarTsechansky, and Macskassy (2008), the ﬁnancial dictionary of Loughran and McDonald (2011), and a proprietary Thomson-Reuters neural network. Simpler processing techniques predict short-term returns that are quickly reversed, while more sophisticated techniques predict larger and more persistent returns. Conﬁrming previous research, daily news predicts stock returns for only 1-2 days. But weekly news predicts stock returns for a quarter year. Positive news stories increase stock returns quickly, but negative stories have a long-delayed reaction.},

	abstract = {In this work we present a deep learning based methodology for predicting eventdriven stock rallies. We apply neural methods to the data presented in [1] as well as a dataset created for this work that includes tweets. We implement a combination of neural networks using both textual and non-textual features to predict stock movements on days of 8-K report ﬁlings. Our best model, on the dataset from [1] (Task 1) using GloVe embeddings with an LSTM and fully connected layers achieves an accuracy of 51\%. Our model on the generated dataset (Task 2) performs at a 52.61\% accuracy. In both tasks, we observe that adding textual information improves model performance. We also ﬁnd that the attention distribution over full tweets yields exciting qualitative results, giving higher scores to tweets with rich information content.},
