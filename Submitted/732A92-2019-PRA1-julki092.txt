This text mining project makes use of filings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 
in particular 8-K filings, to forecast short-term percentage changes in stock prices. 8-K filings 
have to be published by public companies in the U.S. for certain defined, business-relevant events. 
The forecasting problem is approached as a classification problem with five classes: large decrease, 
small decrease, no change, small increase and large increase (of the stock price before and after 
filing date of the 8-K filing). Instead of using existing data sets, a new, up-to-date data set is 
created, with data for the year 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. Furthermore, this project makes 
a contribution by testing a new approach to this problem: gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) 
with tf-idf bag-of-words. Previous research had found random forests to perform very well on this 
problem. Hence, the methodological choice for this project fell on GBDT as a more advanced ensemble 
model. Exclusively text data was used for training the models. The best model could achieve an 
additional 10 percentage points of accuracy on the test data compared to the majority classifier, 
which is comparable to previous findings from the literature.
